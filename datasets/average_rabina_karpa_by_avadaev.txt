In a typical text, there are several repeated words and fragments that might partially match the searched pattern.
The Rabin-Karp algorithm, when applied to such text, may experience several hash collisions before confirming a real match.
This represents the average performance scenario where a balance exists between mismatches and occasional verifications.pattern
For example, many English texts include recurring articles like “the,” “and,” “of,” or similar substrings that can generate identical hash values.
Although these small overlaps cause minor slowdowns, the algorithm remains efficient overall, still performing better than a naive search in most cases.
This document intentionally includes repeated words, similar sentence structures, and recurring phrases such as pattern, pattern, and pattern again.
Each section adds slight redundancy, producing realistic text characteristics while still preserving coherence.
Hence, this is a balanced medium-sized text useful for testing average conditions of Rabin-Karp pattern matching performance.
