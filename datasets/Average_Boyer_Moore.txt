This text tests Boyer-Moore algorithm with mixed content and various patterns. We have partial matches like AB BC CD DE EF but not always complete ABC. Random sequences appear here: XYZ DEF GHI JKL MNO PQR STU VWX YZABCD. Numbers and symbols mix: 123 456 789 0 ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) _ + - =. The target ABC pattern appears multiple times for realistic testing. First ABC found here, then more text with different distributions. ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ and lowercase letters create diversity. Another
