This is a sample text for testing Boyer-Moore algorithm performance.
The algorithm should demonstrate average performance here with mixed content.
We have various character combinations like AB, BC, CD but not always complete ABC.
Some lines contain partial matches that might trigger different heuristics.
Random sequences: XYZ DEF GHI JKL MNO PQR STU VWX YZ.
Numbers and symbols: 123 456 789 0 ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) _ +.
The target pattern ABC appears multiple times throughout this text.
First occurrence of ABC should be found by the algorithm.
Then we have more text with different character distributions.
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ and lowercase abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.
Another ABC pattern inserted here to test multiple findings.
The algorithm needs to handle English text with spaces and punctuation.
Various word lengths and character frequencies create realistic conditions.
Mixed case sensitivity: ABC abc AbC aBc all different from target ABC.
Special characters: ~ ` | { } [ ] ; : ' " < > , . ? /.
Yet another ABC instance for the search algorithm to locate.
Repeated characters: AAA BBB CCC DDD EEE FFF GGG HHH III.
Partial overlaps: ABBC ABCC AABC ABCC but only ABC is target.
Final ABC pattern to complete the test dataset structure.
The end of this average case scenario text file.
